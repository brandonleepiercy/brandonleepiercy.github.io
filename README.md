This repository contains the files neccesary to create a barebones version of what will be my portfolio website in the future. The website was made primarily with html and css, with some elements coming from bootstrap. Placeholder images are used throughout the website because photos haven't been taken and projects have not been started, yet.

The design is minimal, I strongly dislike websites with busy interfaces and competing elements. This is an attempt to be straightforward.

For future versions of the site:
- More colored elements, more visual stimulation
- Actual content in place of Lorem statements
- Images in the jumbotron and on the about me page
- Add a favicon
